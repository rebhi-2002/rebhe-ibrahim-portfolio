          Redux Toolkit: The Industry Standard
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, recommended way to write Redux
          logic. It simplifies store setup, eliminates boilerplate, and includes
          the most common Redux addons by default. It's the go-to for
          large-scale applications requiring a predictable data flow and
          powerful debugging tools.

  },
});`}
        />
        <ProsCard title="Best For">

          Zustand: The Minimalist Challenger
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Zustand offers absolute simplicity. It's a small, fast, and scalable
          state management solution using a minimalist API based on hooks. It's
          perfect for projects that want to escape the complexity of Redux.

          The Atomic Approach: Jotai & Recoil
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Unlike a single large store, atomic state management libraries like
          Jotai and Recoil manage state in small, isolated pieces called
          "atoms." This provides high flexibility and ensures that components
          only re-render when the specific atoms they subscribe to are updated.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
          code={`import { atom, useAtom } from 'jotai';

// Create an atom of state
const countAtom = atom(0);

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useAtom(countAtom);
  //...
}`}
        />
        <ProsCard title="Best For">

          Reactive Magic: MobX & Valtio
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          For developers who prefer a reactive programming paradigm. These
          libraries allow you to create "observable" state. When you mutate this
          state, the UI updates automatically, as if by magic. Valtio, from the
          creators of Zustand and Jotai, is a particularly simple proxy-based
          implementation of this concept.
        </p>
        <CodeBlock
          code={`import { proxy, useSnapshot } from 'valtio';

// Create a proxy state object
const state = proxy({ count: 0 });

function Counter() {
  const snap = useSnapshot(state);
  // state.count++ // Mutate it anywhere!
  //...
}`}
        />
        <ProsCard title="Best For">
          Projects where state is highly interconnected and changes frequently.
          It's for developers who love the "it just works" feeling of reactive
          programming.

          Conclusion: Choosing Your Tool
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          There is no single "best" state management libraryâ€”only the best one
          for your specific use case. Redux Toolkit provides a robust,
          predictable fortress for large applications. Zustand offers elegant
          simplicity and speed. Atomic libraries like Jotai give you ultimate
          flexibility, while reactive libraries like Valtio provide a magical
          developer experience. Understanding these trade-offs is the key to
          building great React applications.

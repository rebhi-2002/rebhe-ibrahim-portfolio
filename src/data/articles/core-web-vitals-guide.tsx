          What Are Core Web Vitals?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Core Web Vitals are a set of specific metrics that Google considers
          crucial for a website's overall user experience. They measure
          real-world user experience for loading performance, interactivity, and
          visual stability of a page. A good score in Core Web Vitals can lead
          to better engagement, lower bounce rates, and a ranking boost in
          Google search results.

          Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Perceived Loading Speed
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          LCP measures the time it takes for the largest content element (e.g.,
          a hero image or a large block of text) to become visible within the
          viewport. It's a key indicator of how quickly a user feels that the
          page is useful. A good LCP score is **2.5 seconds or less**.

          <li>

          <li>
            <strong>Preload Critical Resources:</strong> Tell the browser to
            fetch your main LCP image sooner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reduce Server Response Time (TTFB):</strong> Use a CDN and
            efficient server-side caching.

          Interaction to Next Paint (INP): Responsiveness
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          INP measures how quickly a page responds to user interactions, such as
          clicks, taps, or key presses. It observes the latency of all
          interactions throughout a user's visit and reports a single value. A
          low INP means the page feels responsive and smooth. A good INP score
          is **200 milliseconds or less**.
        </p>
        <WarningBox>
          <strong>Heads Up!</strong> INP has officially replaced First Input
          Delay (FID) as a Core Web Vital as of March 2024. INP is a more
          comprehensive measure of overall responsiveness.

          <li>
            <strong>Optimize Event Callbacks:</strong> Keep your event handling
            code lean and fast.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoid Excessive DOM Size:</strong> A large and complex DOM
            tree can slow down rendering and interactivity.

        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          CLS measures the visual stability of a page by quantifying how much
          its content unexpectedly shifts around during loading. A low CLS score
          ensures a delightful experience, preventing users from accidentally
          clicking the wrong thing because an ad or image suddenly loaded. A
          good CLS score is **0.1 or less**.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Optimizing for Core Web Vitals is fundamentally about optimizing for
          your users. By focusing on a fast, responsive, and stable experience,
          you're not just appeasing search enginesâ€”you're building a better
          product. Treat these metrics as a guide, and continuously monitor and
          improve them as part of your development lifecycle.
